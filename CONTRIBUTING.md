# Contributing to Foresight

👋 Thanks for checking out Foresight!

**Please Note:** This is primarily a personal project that I maintain for my own use. While I've made the code public in hopes that it might be useful to others, I am not actively seeking major feature contributions at this time.

## Expectations

- **Bug Reports**: You are welcome to open issues for bugs you encounter. I appreciate the heads-up!
- **Feature Requests**: You can suggest features, but please understand that I will likely only implement them if they align with my own roadmap and needs.
- **Pull Requests**: Please **open an issue to discuss your changes first** before opening a PR. I may not merge PRs that add complexity or features I don't intend to maintain long-term.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind and respectful. This is a free, open-source tool shared in good faith.

## Development

If you want to build the project locally, please see [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
